This is the PIC 16F84 ArchC functional model.

To generate the simulator you must first run the ACSIM command line:

    acsim pic16F84.ac

Then you should build the simulator, as follows:

    make -f Makefile.archc

To run applications on the simulator, perform:

    pic16F84.x --load=<file-path>

There are two formats recognized for <file-path>:
- ELF binary matching ArchC specifications
- hexadecimal text file for ArchC

WARNING
=======
This model assumes that the instruction word size is 16 bits (due to a
limitation of ArchC's current version), while the real word size is 14 bits. To
run a program in this model, it is necessary to add two dummy 0 (zero) bits at
the left of the actual 14-bit instruction representation.
